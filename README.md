# Trading Backend API – Assignment Submission

## Overview

This project implements a simplified trading backend using **Node.js and Express**.  
It exposes RESTful APIs to simulate core trading operations such as viewing tradable instruments, placing buy and sell orders, checking order status, viewing executed trades, and fetching portfolio holdings.

The system uses **in-memory data storage** and assumes a **single mocked user**, as required by the assignment.
